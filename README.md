# AtomArray: Automatic Differentiation Library

## Introduction

AtomArray is a foundational automatic differentiation (autograd) library designed to streamline and simplify the intricacies of gradient computations. Born out of a pivot from a neural network endeavor, AtomArray encapsulates the essence of deep learning fundamentals in a "toy" version, while harboring the power and potential to grow into a comprehensive toolset.

## Features

- **Multi-dimensional Data Handling**: Efficiently process and manage data in various shapes and sizes.
- **Batch Operations Support**: Execute operations on batched data, accelerating computations and ensuring scalability.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Utilize advanced visualization capabilities to inspect and debug computational graphs.
- **Comprehensive Mathematical Operations**: Perform a range of mathematical operations, each accompanied by its gradient computation, vital for backpropagation in neural networks.

## Upcoming Enhancements

While AtomArray is currently in its foundational phase, continuous improvements are underway. In the near future, expect:

- Tailored features for specialized domains, expanding AtomArray's reach and applicability.
- Advanced optimization techniques and integration capabilities with popular machine learning frameworks.
- Improved error handling, debugging tools, and comprehensive documentation for an enriched user experience.
